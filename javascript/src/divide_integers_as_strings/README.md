# 3kyu Divide integers as strings

Given positive integers `a` and `b` as strings, evaluate `a / b` and return the quotient and the remainder as strings in the form `[quotient, remainder]` (`vector<string> {quotient, remainder}` in C++).

-   `a` and `b` can be very large (at the order of `10^150` to `10^200`)

-   As usual, your result should not have leading 0s

-   `require` is disabled in JavaScript. Do it yourself ;-)
